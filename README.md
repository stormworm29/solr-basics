# solr-basics
A Dive into the basics of Apache SOLR. Have used SOLR version 5.5.5 since it was compatible with Adobe Experience Manager in my case, still basics are the same in all versions. Included some references for connecting SOLR with Apache Zookeeper, and customising the Apache Tika parser to get custom parsing implementations.
